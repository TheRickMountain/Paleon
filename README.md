# Paleon

**Paleon** is an indie colony simulation game where the player's time machine breaks down, leaving him stranded in the Stone Age. Your goal is to rebuild a civilization from scratch, progress through technology eras up to the Iron Age, construct a new time machine, and return to the present.

## Personal Note

This was my **first major project** that reached a full release. It started as an experiment to learn C#, game development, and how to build an 2D engine from scratch.

The codebase reflects the learning curve I experienced â€” some early parts of the code are suboptimal due to inexperience and uncertainty about the game's direction at the time. If I were to start this project today, I would do many things differently based on the experience I gained during development.
